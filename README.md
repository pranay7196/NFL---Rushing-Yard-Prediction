# NFL---Rushing-Yard-Prediction
## NFL Big Data Bowl 2019
Develop a model for the NFL- Big Data Bowl Competition to predict the number of rushing yards Gained/Lost in an Offensive Play for the NFL

This project is for MGMT 590- Predictive Analytics at Krannert School of Management, developed by Team : Abhinav Chanda, Pranay Khandelwal and Tirthankar Mukhopadhyay. This is a data science model and implementation of a stock market prediction for Walt Disney Co.

As part of the Kaggle NFL Big Data Bowl 2020, we developed a sequential neural network to predict the number of rushing yards an NFL team would gain/lose on each play.

The data provided was part of NFL's NextGen Stats. The training data was broken down play-wise into 22 rows. Each row corresponding to a single player on the field. The data points included fields such as player orientation, positional coordinates on the field, offensive formation, defensive formation, weather conditions, speed, weight, acceleration, etc.

We developed around 30 new features based on our understanding of the game. A few features we generated were momentum, yards gained vs distance to goal, bucketed jersey numbers, etc. We used an ensemble feature importance algorithm to select a total of 24 features from a total of around 70.

A TensorFlow based sequential neural network was used to generate the final predictions. We optimized our neural network using Bayesian Optimization techniques to determine the optimal number of layers, nodes, dropout, etc.

The testing for this project was unique in that live matches were used to test our predictions. Our algorithm was run prior to each match from mid-December to the end of the season. Our team finished in the top 30% worldwide on the Kaggle leaderboard, and we were one of the few all-University teams.
